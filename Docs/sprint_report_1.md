## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
During Sprint 1, our team focused on gathering requirements, analyzing the clientâ€™s current platform, and establishing a strong technical foundation.  
We met twice with our client (Gaye Hallman and Patty) to identify core needs and confirm priorities: story submission, donation processing, event management, and CMS usability.  
From these meetings, we documented user stories, use cases, UML diagrams, and system specifications. Each team member contributed distinct rolesâ€”Natan led documentation, Julian handled UML and architecture, and Kyle researched framework setup.  
We evaluated the existing AWW site, identified performance and usability issues, and outlined our improvement roadmap. The team also familiarized itself with React, Node.js/Express, and MongoDB to prepare for full-stack development in Sprint 2.

## Unfinished Work
We planned to complete prototype design for website. 
This task has been carried over to Sprint 2, where weâ€™ll focus on connecting both layers and integrating MongoDB for persistent storage.

## Retrospective Summary

### Here's what went well:
  * Productive client communication and clear documentation.
  * Well-organized task distribution using Kanban.
  * Successful completion of all Sprint 1 documentation deliverables.
  * Gained foundational understanding of React, Node.js, and MongoDB.

### Here's what we'd like to improve:
  * Start development earlier in the sprint to allow time for testing.
  * Reduce overlap in task ownership by defining subtasks more clearly.
  * Improve consistency in version control and commit message conventions.

### Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
  * Connect the front-end and back-end frameworks.
  * Implement database models for users, stories, and events.
